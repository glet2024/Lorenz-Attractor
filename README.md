Using the following system of ODEs known as the Lorenz equations, I plot a dynamic solution to the system assuming the same variable values that Lorenz 
himself used in 1963 when he developed this model

As the plotting progesses, we see the attractor takes the shape of a butterfly. It demonstrates a likeness to order within a dynamical and chaotic system


The Lorenz equations implemented, along with the assumed values of the system parameters:
